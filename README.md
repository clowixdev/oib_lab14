# Laboratory work for University

### DOS attacks modeling

In this laboratory work we have to simulate a different type
(SYN-flood / ICMP-flood) of attacks with packet generators 
and try to defend from them.

Also, two VM's was connected in one local network and they were
forced to attack each other with hping3 - Linux ping utility


###ACCEPTED!
